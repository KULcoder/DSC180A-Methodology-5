## Answers 
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain is the method of investigating feature learning of neural network. In my opinion, feature learning is the core of why machine learning works. Feature learning is the procedure to transform, to extract, to emphasis important information in the raw data by machine learning algorithm.

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**

One bold (might be too hard to do) is developing systematic feature analysis methods and tools to analyze transformer features.

- **What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I think we will firstly set up a more frequent meeting with teammates to accelarate development. Moreover, we might choose a work environment online to make our research more consistent.

- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I think more visualization or presentation techniques will be better. For example, tutorial on tensorboard, wandb, or something like tabular, might help make better presentations.
